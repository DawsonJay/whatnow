# WhatNow

**An AI-powered activity recommendation system that learns your preferences over time.**

## Overview

WhatNow helps you decide what to do when you're feeling indecisive. Set your current mood, energy level, social preference, available time, and weather conditions, and WhatNow suggests activities tailored to your preferences. The AI learns from your choices and gets better at predicting what you'll enjoy.

## Core Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Smart Recommendations
- Input your current state using intuitive sliders (mood, energy, social, time)
- Get 50 personalized activity suggestions
- AI highlights top recommendations based on learned preferences

### ðŸ”„ Iterative Refinement
- Pick your top 3 favorite activities from suggestions
- Regenerate for 50 new suggestions if needed
- Previous favorites accumulate across rounds
- Keep refining until you find the perfect activity

### ðŸ§  Two-Layer AI Learning System

**Within-Session Learning (Fast)**
- Temporary AI copy learns aggressively during your session (learning rate: 0.8)
- Each regeneration produces better suggestions based on your picks
- Helps you quickly zero in on what you want right now
- Resets after session ends

**Cross-Session Learning (Slow)**
- Persistent base AI learns gradually from all sessions (learning rate: 0.02)
- Builds long-term understanding of your preferences
- Robust to outliers - one bad session won't break it
- Gets smarter with every session

### ðŸ“Š Context-Aware Learning
- Learns different preferences for different contexts
- Understands "I like hiking when sunny and energetic, but Netflix when rainy and tired"
- Adapts to weather, time of day, season, and your current state

## How It Works

1. **Set Your Context**: Use sliders to indicate mood, social desire, energy, time available, and weather
2. **Get Suggestions**: AI generates 50 activity suggestions based on your context and learned preferences
3. **Pick Top 3**: Select your favorite activities from the suggestions
4. **Refine (Optional)**: Click regenerate for new suggestions influenced by your picks
5. **Repeat**: Keep refining until satisfied, accumulating favorites across rounds
6. **Choose & Do**: Pick one activity from your accumulated favorites to actually do
7. **AI Learns**: System learns from your choices to improve future suggestions
